**It is a convention in C++ that variable names should begin with a lowercase letter.**
If the variable or function name is multi-word, there are two common conventions: separated by underscores, or intercapped (sometimes called CamelCase).  

**Identifier:** name of a variable, function, class, or other object in C++. Rules that must be followed include:  
  1. The identifier can not be a keyword. Keywords are reserved.  
  2. The identifier can only be composed of letters (lower or upper case), numbers, and the underscore character. That means the name can not contain symbols (except the underscore) nor whitespace.  
  3. The identifier must begin with a letter (lower or upper case) or an underscore. It can not start with a number.  
  4. C++ distinguishes between lower and upper case letters. nvalue is different than nValue is different than NVALUE.  
  
**Quiz**  
Pick which variables are improperly named according to standard conventions (ie. how you should name a variable) and indicate why.

1) int sum;  
**A: Good!**   
2) int _apples;  
**A: variables should not start with underscore**  
3) int VALUE;  
**A: ariable should start with lower case letter**  
4) int my variable name;  
**A: variable name cannot contain spaces**  
5) int TotalCustomers;  
**A: variable name should start with lower case**  
6) int void;  
**A: void is a reserved keyword**  
7) int nAngle;  
**A: Good!**   
8) int 3some;  
**A: variable name can not start with a number**  
9) int meters_of_pipe;
