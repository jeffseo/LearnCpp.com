Quiz 2.6 - Boolean Values

1) A prime number is a whole number greater than 1 that can only be divided evenly by 1 and itself. Write a program that asks the user to enter a single digit integer. If the user enters a single digit that is prime (2, 3, 5, or 7), print “The digit is prime”. Otherwise, print “The digit is not prime”.

Hint: Use if statements to compare the number the user entered to the prime numbers. Use a boolean to keep track of whether the user entered a prime number or not.
